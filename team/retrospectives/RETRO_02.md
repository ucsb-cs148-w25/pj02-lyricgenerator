## Start, Stop, Continue

### Start
- Have someone strictly on sysadmin for deployment.
- Intergrate feedback from the MVP presentations.
- Using the Github issues and Kanban board more effectively, any issues in text should be translated into the kanban board.

### Stop
- Nothing to note.

### Continue
- Communication, but communicate better outside of in person meetings, i.e. attendance and platform of attendance.
- Deadlines, but be more strict about the deadlines.
- Splitting the tasks as necessary.
- Keeping more track of the requirements from the labs.

- ## Retro Assessment - Sanjana 

* Retro outline or process used: I used the Start, Stop and Continue method for our retrospective where we each talked about what we should as a team do better and what we need to continue doing better as well as what we need to stop doing. 
* Although the retrospective was a pretty short session I think it went well because everyone had something to say about what we need to improve as well as what we have been doing well. I think an observation that i made was that we did not have anything to say when it came about discussing about what we need to stop doing which I thought was definitely an improvement from the last time we did our retro. 
* One piece of advice that I would give is to make sure to include everyone who didn't speak or share their thoughts to share their thoughts explicitly if everyone has not spoken yet because it is important to provide a comfortable environment for everyone to share their concerns and reflect on how they have been doing in the team and individually.
