## Start, Stop, Continue

### Start
- Have someone strictly on sysadmin for deployment.
- Intergrate feedback from the MVP presentations.
- Using the Github issues and Kanban board more effectively, any issues in text should be translated into the kanban board.

### Stop
- Nothing to note.

### Continue
- Communication, but communicate better outside of in person meetings, i.e. attendance and platform of attendance.
- Deadlines, but be more strict about the deadlines.
- Splitting the tasks as necessary.
- Keeping more track of the requirements from the labs.
