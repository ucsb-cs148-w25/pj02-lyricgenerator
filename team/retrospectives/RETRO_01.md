## Action item
* a goal: we want to better update everyone on where the technical updates are without taking up time during scrums 
* a change/experiment: we will update everyone before our meeting on the updates of development 
* a measurement: we will survey everyone in a few scrums or at the next review to see how things are and if efficiency improved 

## Retro Assessment 

- **Preparation:** Defined a clear goal for the retro and shared it with the team beforehand.
- **Framework:** Used the "Start, Stop, Continue" method to encourage focused discussions.
- **Tools:** Had someone else scribe so it went more efficiently and used the input of our assigned TA.

## Assessment of How It Went
Overall, the retro went well. The team was engaged, provided thoughtful feedback, and collaborated effectively. The process allowed for productive discussions and actionable takeaways, fostering a positive and inclusive environment.

## Advice for the Next Person Leading a Retro
1. **Set the Tone:** Begin with an icebreaker or an informal topic (keep it short) to create a comfortable atmosphere.
2. **Stay Focused:** Clearly outline the structure, and timebox each section to keep the discussion on track.
3. **Encourage Participation:** Ensure everyoneâ€™s voice is heard, especially quieter team members.
4. **Actionable Outcomes:** End with clear, prioritized action items to ensure follow-through.

## Experiment/Change

* We will update everyone in our slack/msg channels of our developmental progress before each meeting from the entire team, even if they will not be apart of the meeting. That way, if there are difficulties, we can identify them potentially before our meeting and before it is too late. 
* TODO: A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* TODO: A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
