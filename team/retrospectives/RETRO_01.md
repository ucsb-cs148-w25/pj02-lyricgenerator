## Action item
* a goal: we want to better update everyone on where the technical updates are without taking up time during scrums 
* a change/experiment: we will update everyone before our meeting on the updates of development 
* a measurement: we will survey everyone in a few scrums or at the next review to see how things are and if efficiency improved 

## Retro Assessment (TODO: TO BE FILLED BY RETRO LEADER)

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

## Experiment/Change

* We will update everyone in our slack/msg channels of our developmental progress before each meeting from the entire team, even if they will not be apart of the meeting. That way, if there are difficulties, we can identify them potentially before our meeting and before it is too late. 
* TODO: A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* TODO: A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
