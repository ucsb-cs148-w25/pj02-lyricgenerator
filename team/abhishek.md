I'm Abhishek, a third year computer science student with a minor in statistics. I'm from the Bay Area, and some of my hobbies include playing chess, watching sports, and going on walks. I am excited to work on this project using deep learning services to query for music lyrics that accurately caption an image. I think some development features could include having a database to query for all prior song-caption pairings made by a user, as well as using a Redis cache to speed generation time up.
