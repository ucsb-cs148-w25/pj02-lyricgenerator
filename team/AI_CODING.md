- Working with Copilot on VScode. It is very helpful with suggestions but will sometimes miss items. I utilize it more for intellisense uses more than code suggestions. They way it codes is not compatable with my style. I really only needed to adjust it a few times for my specific use cases for it to understand what I was looking for.
