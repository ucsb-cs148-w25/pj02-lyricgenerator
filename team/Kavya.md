My name is Kavya Verma and I'm a 4th year CS major, I'm interested in React/React Native and UI/UX design. I took CS 184 last quarter, where my team and I worked on a mobile application with React Native, so I look forward to learning React as well. My idea for this project is to create an engaging and appealing user interface that presents a lyric caption in a specific style based on the sentiment analysis from the image that the user uploads.
