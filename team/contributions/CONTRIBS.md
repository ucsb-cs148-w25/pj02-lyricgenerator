- I think the contributors graph is not accurately showing commits since I have made around 10 PRs with many commits in each branch, -but the commits graph has nothing showing up. If you filter for PRs under my name, you will see all the PRs and the associated commits which show all the work done below.
- Called Gemini API to get genre detection
- Helped with ideation of the project and workflows
- Created a Contact Us Page and Form; linked so that someone from the development team gets an email when new feedback comes in
- Made backend Flask routes for genre-based detection; researched MusixMatch API to retrieve lyrics
- Implemented PyTorch model with a lyrics array to receive most appropriate lyric caption based on cosine similarity
- Set up unit tests for React using “react-unit-testing” library
- Local fixes to codebase when things stopped working

- Contributors graph does not accurately represent my contributions to the app. 
- Wrote initial code to call the Gemini api to analyze the image and return a song. Also wrote the function to get a lyric caption for the image from Gemini based on the previously returned song.
- Designed the flow after the user hits the “Generate” button. This includes the UI and using basic cards to display the caption/image to eventually formatting it as a Polaroid card. Also added place holder buttons allowing the user to save image/caption, copy the caption, delete the image and share to Instagram.
- Added functionality to the front end to allow the user to submit multiple images (still needs to be connected to the backend)
Fixed bug that allows the user to completely log out from the app.
