Retro Strategy: Start, Stop, Continue
Start: Next spring, every single time we meet have been doing a lot of prototyping and do code shows and where we are, need a lot of communication to send data between front end and back end, keeping everyone updated with the technical updates and progress. Period where we brainstorm. 
Stop: Improve communicating with everyone who is not there in person to make sure that everyone is on the same page. 
Continue: Communicating well 

1. Individual Reflection (10-15 minutes)
Take a moment to reflect individually on the past sprint.
Write down 3-5 bullet points for Start, Stop, Continue.
Abhi: Doing good job communciating, using messaging channel quite well, continue doing that and asking questions, development side looking at Google authentication development side
Kavya: Doing well communicating divide work pretty organized way, updating each other frequently, created some of the wireframes and wireflow, start working on the homepage styling using React
Sanjana: Doing well with communicating and splitting up tasks based on our experience and what we want to learn, looking into Genius API, Spotify API, and The Lyrics API
Angel: Come up with a plan to using lyrics API and spotify API,
Alice: Looking into MongoDB this weekend

Experimental to try for the next spring meeting: Update our technnical updates that we are working on before the meetings in person just in case 
if any of the members are having any difficulties we can help each other make valid decisions before it becomes too late. 

Common Examples:
Start: “Start having more frequent check-ins with the team”
Stop: “Stop having meetings without an agenda”
Continue: “Continue updating the group on the Slack channel”
3. Group Discussion (20-30 minutes)
Each person shares their Start, Stop, Continue points.
Once each person is done sharing, the group should have a discussion.
The retro leader should make sure everyone is actively engaged in the discussion. They should not share their points until the very end. As they are monitoring the conversion they should jot down notes of the discussion.
Collectively decide on 3-5 points for Start, Stop, Continue.
