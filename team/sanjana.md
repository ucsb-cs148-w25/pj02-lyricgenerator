My name is Sanjana Shankar and I am a 4th year Computer Science Major. I have been programming for a while since I was in middle school but the majority 
of my programming experience was not necessarily project based and therefore I am looking forward to creating this web application using full stack web application development and to gain experience using languages such as React as this will be my first time using React and deploying an application. Although, I do have experience with programming with APIs such as Google's GEMINI API to develop an application and therefore my goal for this project is to create a web application using react as the frontend library, Flask for backend, and AWS for deploying the web application and using the Genius API which will provide segmentation analysis functionality to analyze a picture and generate a song lyric and serves as a caption that is associated with the image inputted into the application.
