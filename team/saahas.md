I am Saahas Buricha, a 3rd year junior majoring in Computer Science at UCSB. I have a high interest in creating and developing software related apps and projects. I have experience working on projects through my research over summer which was related to Machine Learning and Neural Networks. I look forward to sharpening my skillset this quarter by learning how to use different web frameworks. I also look forward to working on a project in a team setting and picking up on new skills.
