# Evaluation Response

1.  Decisions your team is making regarding the feedback on your `USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md`

-  Matched what we requested
-  Feedback about the UI, but liked how it looked
-  Droppig and uploading files are good to go
-  Liked the account login features, good work
-  Profile picture is appreciated, yay
-  User friendly and easy to navigate, good job team

1.  Additional decisions your team is making based on feedback you received. Please reference what reviewing form section (numbers 2-5 above)   the feedback you are reacting to came from (this is important to the teaching team!) and state your plans regarding that feedback. (Not all plans need to be able to be implemented - it is ok to talk about stretch goals. The important part is the team discussion regarding the best possible end product.)

- Form section number 2: UI colors: we will not be changing the colors as the majority of people liked it.
- All other feedback was positive and we will continue to polish the app until it is production ready
