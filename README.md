# Project: Song Lyric Caption Generator 

## One Sentence Description

A web application that analyzes images and generates song lyrics as a caption. 

## Paragraph
We will use Flask and React to build the web application. Based on the image analysis, we will use the Genius API to retrieve song lyrics. We plan to use Gemini for the segmentation analysis. Ideally, a user would input an image into the web app, which would generate an accompanying set of song lyrics as a caption for the image.
