# This is the Django stack
There can be any front-end framework on top of this. Some team members are exploring `React` and others `Angular` and `Vue`. However, for a backend this works fine.

## Requirements
- Python3
- Django

## How to run
- Clone the repository
- For convenience here in the exploring phase, we have included the entire `venv` folder. However, this folder should not be included in the repository and should be removed before pushing to the repository.
- Run `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Go into the `django_helloworld` directory
- Run `python3 manage.py runserver`
- You can click on the link that appears in the terminal to view the website locally
