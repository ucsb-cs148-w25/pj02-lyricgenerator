# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project: Song Lyric Caption Generator 

## One Sentence Description

A web application that analyzes images and generates song lyrics as a caption. 

## Paragraph
We will use Flask and React to build the web application. Based on the image analysis, we will use the Genius API to retrieve song lyrics. We plan to use Gemini for the segmentation analysis. Ideally, a user would input an image into the web app, which would generate an accompanying set of song lyrics as a caption for the image. 

## User Roles
- **Anonymous User**: Anyone on the web who isn't logged in. They can view the website and get information about our app and pricing but cannot do anything about it.
- **Simple User**: A logged-in user who occasionally uploads a single photo and casually interacts with our app.
- **Power User**: A logged-in user who bulk-uploads many photos and interacts with our app frequently.
- **Admin**: A privileged user who manages other users and access across the app and can see information pertaining to the app.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which version(s) of your framework(s) of choice)

### Dependencies

TODO: List which libraries / add-ons you added to the project, and the purpose each of those add-ons serves in your app.

### Installation Steps

TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you give complete instructions to get your project going from scratch).
Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. Note that with the use of GitHub Actions, these instructions can eventually be fully automated (e.g. with [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), you can run GitHub Actions locally).

## Functionality

TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section,
and showcase your features.

## Known Problems

TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells.
Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.

## Contributing

TODO: Leave the steps below if you want others outside your team to contribute to your project.

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
